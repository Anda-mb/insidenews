            <h1 class="l-heading">About Self-Care</h1>
            <p>
              "Self-care is probably something most of us give insufficient
              consideration to, preferring instead to focus our care and
              compassion on the needs of others such as family and friends.
              However, if we fail to look after ourselves well enough we will
              inevitably deplete our limited reserves of energy and discover
              that we can no longer do the things that are important to us and
              which give meaning and purpose to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take care”, “Look after yourself”, “Mind yourself”, “Take care of
              yourself” – these are phrases we use every day when talking to
              family and friends. We are so quick to advise others to look after
              themselves but how often do we apply them to ourselves? Self-care
              means caring for oneself. It is said that we cannot love another
              person without first loving ourselves. I believe the same applies
              to self-care. In order to care for another person we must care for
              ourselves first.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is it important? Self-care encourages you to maintain a
              healthy relationship with yourself so that you can transmit the
              good feelings to others. You cannot give to others what you don't
              have yourself. While some may misconstrue self-care as selfish,
              it's far from that. When you pay adequate attention to your
              well-being, you're not considering your needs alone. You're
              reinvigorating yourself so that you can be the best version of
              yourself for the people around you. Everyone around you also
              benefits from the renewed energy and joy you exhibit.""
